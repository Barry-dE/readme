<h3 align="center"> Hey Yo! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>  I'm Shedrack Akintayo! </h3>

I love to [write](https://sheddy.xyz), code, and [teach](https://sheddy.xyz/pages/talks).

I'm trying to embrace constant learning, and growing. I'm currently working towards becoming a better version of myself.

I currently run the [Cilium](https://cilium.io) and [eBPF](https://ebpf.io) communities at [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com). At Isovalent, we are working on products for eBPF-based networking, security, and observability.
