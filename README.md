I love to [write](https://sheddy.xyz), code, and [teach](https://sheddy.xyz/pages/talks).

I'm trying to embrace constant learning, growing and I'm currently working towards becoming a better version of myself.

I currently do Developer Advocacy ğŸ¥‘ things at [Cloud Foundry Foundation](https://cloudfoundry.org) and it's a really fun job.

I'm quite interested in improving the experience of developer centered products, I aim to make developers happy ğŸ˜„
