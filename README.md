I love to [write](https://sheddy.xyz), code, and [teach](https://sheddy.xyz/pages/talks).

I'm trying to embrace constant learning, and growing. I'm currently working towards becoming a better version of myself.

I currently run the [Cilium](https://cilium.io) and [eBPF](https://ebpf.io) communities at [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com), where we are working on eBPF-based networking, security, and observability.
